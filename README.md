Our idea is to create a chat that contains different group chats (from 1 to 5 people). We know that a lot of groups will do something similar to our project and this is why we want to extend it by adding a chat history.

The history will be stored in a text file that could be loaded if the user asks for it.

The functionnalities are the following :

User can choose a group chat among which he has access to
User can write messages in these group chats
User can receive messages from other users in these group chats
User can load the history of the group chat he's in
